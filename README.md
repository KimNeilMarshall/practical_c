### Practical C - by Steve Oulline - 3rd Edition 

Cataloging every example and bit of interesting code in Practical C by S. Oualline 1997 for the #100DayOfCode challange.

I hope to finish the book I started in 1999, with a rewritten working c file with notations of the how why and where of the 
book, beyond this I hope to complete some other books on C and then move on to Haskell programming examples.

Cheers for looking, stay safe in these werid times and find something you want to do -  Kim
